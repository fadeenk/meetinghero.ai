Thanks for the invitation to discuss [Topic].

After thinking about the goal of this discussion ([Mention the goal]), I believe we might be able to achieve it effectively and perhaps more efficiently by [Suggest Async Method].

This approach would allow participants to engage on their own schedule and would free up synchronous time.

Would you be open to trying this instead? I can [Explain your async action] by [Suggest a timeframe].

If, after reviewing or discussing async, we find we still need real-time interaction, we can schedule a focused meeting then.

Let me know what you think.

Instead of scheduling a meeting for [Topic], I've decided to share/discuss this asynchronously to respect everyone's time and schedule flexibility.

Please review and share your thoughts / feedback / answer by [Suggest a deadline].

I'll consolidate feedback or we can discuss any critical points briefly during [mention existing async or sync forum].

Regarding the meeting scheduled/proposed for [Topic], I was thinking we could potentially make our sync time more productive (or even reduce the need for the full meeting) by doing some asynchronous preparation first.
