				information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into
				your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account
				Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, when
				you sign up for an account using Google Calendar we may import the contents of your Google
				Calendar account, including without limitation any calendars to which you have access, to
				your MeetingHero.AI Account. Certain information may be required to register with us or to
				take advantage of some of our features.
